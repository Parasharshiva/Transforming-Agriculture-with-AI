 Artificial Intelligence (AI) in agriculture refers to the integration and application of advanced computational 
technologies, including machine learning, computer vision, robotics, and data analytics, to enhance various aspects 
of agricultural practices. The goal is to leverage intelligent systems to improve efficiency, productivity, and 
sustainability throughout the agricultural value chain. AI in agriculture involves the use of algorithms and models 
that enable machines to perform tasks traditionally carried out by humans, enabling smarter decision-making, 
precise resource management, and improved outcomes in farming practices.
